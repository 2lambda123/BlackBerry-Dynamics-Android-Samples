WebView_BDSDK
================

This sample demonstrates the use of com.blackberry.bbwebview.BBWebView, which extends [android.webkit.WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) and provides BlackBerry Dynamics network connectivity. This sample requires the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Android to be installed.  Refer to the Getting Started guide for instructions on how to install and configure it.  https://developers.blackberry.com/us/en/resources/get-started/blackberry-dynamics-getting-started.html?platform=android#step-1

The com.blackberry.bbwebview.BBWebView class is based off of the BlackBerry open source [AndroidWebView](https://github.com/blackberry/BlackBerry-Dynamics-Android-Samples/tree/master/AndroidWebView) sample, which can be used if customization of the WebView is required.
